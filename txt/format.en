Okay, now the network is set up. The next step is to formart your dirve. At this time JetSpace
only supports a manual formatation. But, we will help you with that. Please note, when you formart
a disk, you will LOSE ALL DATA SAVED ON THIS DISK! So you have to check it 3-times to make sure you
have selected the right one. Normaly the Disks in your machine are named hdX or sdX. X is a letter
from 'a' to 'z'. The first disk will get the letter a, the second b and so on. On the next page
you will get an overview of all installed drives. You can choose the drive you want.

At this time we want to remember you, that formarting a hard drive will DELETE EVERYTHING on it,
so please be carefull. We are not responsible for any loose of data.
