The first step is to create a partition layout. This may sounds difficult, but it is easy.

There are two ways:

IF THIS IS THE ONLY OS ON THE COMPUTER

First create a main partition (Here will your data be storred). Then mark this one as bootable

Then create another one, a linux swap partitition. (the size must be your RAM + 20%. Example: 8 GB ram > ~10GB swap)

then remember the numbers of the partititions (normaly 5 and 6)

IF THIS IS NOT THE ONLY OS
